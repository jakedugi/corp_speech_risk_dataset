# Code Generation Rules

- Always use type hints (mypy strict)  
- Default missing values to `"__MISSING__"`  
- One responsibility per module (KISS)  
- Share logic via base classes (DRY)  
- Use async/await for I/O-bound tasks  
- Log all operations with Loguru  
- Wrap risky calls in try/except with logging  
- Write tests for every new feature  
- Use Polars for data manipulation  
- Follow PEP 8, max line length = 88
