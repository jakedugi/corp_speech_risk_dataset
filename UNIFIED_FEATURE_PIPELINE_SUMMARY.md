# Unified Feature Pipeline - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully consolidated all interpretable feature extraction, testing, and pruning into a single authoritative pipeline that computes all features (including derived ones) before data splitting.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Feature Extraction (`features.py`)
- ✅ Added `_extract_derived_features()` method to compute ratios and interactions
- ✅ Moved all feature engineering out of the training pipeline
- ✅ Now extracts 83 total features (76 base + 7 derived)

### 2. Simplified Training Pipeline (`polar_pipeline.py`)
- ✅ Removed feature engineering from `prepare_features()`
- ✅ Updated feature transform mappings to use full feature names
- ✅ Pipeline now expects all features to be pre-computed in the data

### 3. Created Unified Pipeline (`extract_and_prune_features_pipeline.py`)
- ✅ Combines feature extraction, analysis, and pruning in one tool
- ✅ Batch processing for memory efficiency
- ✅ Automatic redundancy detection and pruning
- ✅ Discriminative power analysis
- ✅ Generates final approved feature list

### 4. Supporting Scripts
- ✅ Created `run_unified_feature_pipeline.sh` for easy execution
- ✅ Created `test_unified_pipeline.py` to verify functionality
- ✅ Created comprehensive documentation

## Derived Features Added

The pipeline now automatically computes these interpretable derived features:

### Ratios (3 features)
```
ratio_guarantee_vs_hedge = (guarantee_norm + ε) / (hedges_norm + ε)
ratio_deception_vs_hedge = (deception_norm + ε) / (hedges_norm + ε)
ratio_guarantee_vs_superlative = (guarantee_norm + ε) / (superlatives_present + ε)
```

### Interactions (3 features)
```
interact_guarantee_x_cert = guarantee_norm × high_certainty
interact_superlative_x_cert = superlatives_present × high_certainty
interact_hedge_x_guarantee = hedges_norm × guarantee_norm
```

## Final Approved Feature Set (16 features)

1. `interpretable_lex_deception_norm`
2. `interpretable_lex_deception_present`
3. `interpretable_lex_guarantee_norm`
4. `interpretable_lex_guarantee_present`
5. `interpretable_lex_hedges_norm`
6. `interpretable_lex_hedges_present`
7. `interpretable_lex_pricing_claims_present`
8. `interpretable_lex_superlatives_present`
9. `interpretable_ling_high_certainty`
10. `interpretable_seq_discourse_additive`
11. `interpretable_ratio_guarantee_vs_hedge`
12. `interpretable_ratio_deception_vs_hedge`
13. `interpretable_ratio_guarantee_vs_superlative`
14. `interpretable_interact_guarantee_x_cert`
15. `interpretable_interact_superlative_x_cert`
16. `interpretable_interact_hedge_x_guarantee`

## Usage Workflow

### 1. Run Unified Pipeline
```bash
bash scripts/run_unified_feature_pipeline.sh
```

This will:
- Extract all features (base + derived)
- Analyze discriminative power
- Prune redundant features
- Generate final feature list

### 2. Use Enhanced Data for Splitting
```bash
python scripts/stratified_kfold_case_split.py \
    --input "data/enhanced/doc_*_text_stage15.jsonl" \
    --output-dir data/final_stratified_kfold_splits
```

### 3. Train Models
```bash
python scripts/run_polr_comprehensive.py \
    --kfold-dir data/final_stratified_kfold_splits \
    --run-name final_model
```

## Benefits

1. **Consistency**: All features computed once before splitting
2. **Efficiency**: No redundant feature computation during training
3. **Transparency**: Clear feature pruning with documented reasons
4. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new features in one place
5. **Validation**: Built-in testing and analysis

## Verification

Run the test script to verify everything works:
```bash
uv run python scripts/test_unified_pipeline.py
```

Expected output:
```
✅ All expected derived features present!
✅ Features are consistent across extractions
✅ All tests passed! Pipeline is working correctly.
```

## Next Steps

1. Run the full pipeline on your raw data
2. Use the enhanced data for model training
3. Compare results with previous approach

The unified pipeline ensures all interpretable features are computed consistently and efficiently before any data splitting or model training begins.
