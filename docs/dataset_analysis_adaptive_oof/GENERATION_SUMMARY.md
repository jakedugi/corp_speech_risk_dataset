# Dataset Analysis Generation Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Extended K-Fold Split Generation
- Added **final training fold (fold 3)** that combines all CV data (100 cases)
- Split into 85 training cases and 15 dev cases using temporal ordering
- Calculated tertile boundaries dynamically on training data only
- Maintained all leakage prevention measures

### 2. Updated Figure Generation Script
- Modified to use **dynamic tertile boundaries** from final training fold
- Fixed speaker percentage calculation (now % of total dataset, not just top 10)
- Updated outcome distribution plot to show tertile boundaries
- Improved k-fold visualization labels and formatting

### 3. New Visualizations Created

#### Final Run Distribution (Improved)
- Split into separate coverage and distribution figures
- Shows accurate case/quote percentages
- Uses actual data from fold metadata
- Cleaner bar charts with proper labels

#### Dynamic Tertile Boundaries
- New visualization showing how tertile boundaries shift across folds
- Demonstrates no global boundary leakage
- Shows progression with rolling origin design
- Fold 0: $60M / $229M
- Fold 1: $8M / $229M
- Fold 2: $12.75M / $65M
- Fold 3: $12.75M / $220M (final training)

#### Quotes per Case Distribution (Fixed)
- Better positioned statistics labels
- Shows median, mean, and IQR for each split
- Cleaner box plot formatting

### 4. Documentation Updates
- Changed all references from "quantile" to "tertile"
- Updated boundary analysis to reflect dynamic calculation
- Added explanations of tertile methodology
- Updated class weight documentation

## Key Improvements

1. **No Global Leakage**: Tertile boundaries calculated per-fold on training data only
2. **Temporal Integrity**: Final training fold maintains temporal ordering
3. **Label Coverage**: Adaptive dev ratio ensures minimum 150 quotes in dev set
4. **Visualization Clarity**: Separated complex figures into cleaner components
5. **Accurate Percentages**: Fixed speaker and distribution percentage calculations

## Files Generated

- `final_run_distribution.pdf` - Risk distribution histograms
- `dynamic_tertile_boundaries.pdf` - Shows boundary shifts across folds
- All standard figures updated with tertile boundaries and improved formatting
