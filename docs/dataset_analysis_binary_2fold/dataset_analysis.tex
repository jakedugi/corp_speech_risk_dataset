\section{Stratified K-Fold Cross-Validation Analysis}

\subsection{Methodology Overview}

The dataset employs stratified group k-fold cross-validation with temporal rolling origin design to ensure robust model evaluation while maintaining case-level integrity and temporal validity.

\subsubsection{Binary Cross-Validation Features}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{4-Fold Design}: Rolling origin temporal splits with final training fold
\item \textbf{Binary Stratification}: Maintains balanced representation of lower/higher risk cases
\item \textbf{Per-Fold Boundaries}: Each fold computes its own binary classification threshold
\item \textbf{Quote-Balanced Sampling}: Addresses quote-level imbalance within case-level constraints
\item \textbf{Temporal Purity}: No temporal leakage between training and evaluation sets
\item \textbf{Case-Level Grouping}: All quotes from a single case remain in the same fold (zero case bleed)
\item \textbf{Speaker Separation}: Inter-fold analysis ensures minimal speaker leakage across folds
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Class Weight Analysis}

To address quote-level imbalance while preserving case-level integrity, the dataset employs class weighting based on inverse frequency normalization:


\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{Binary Class Weights for Balanced Training}
\begin{tabular}{lrr}
\toprule
\textbf{Risk Category} & \textbf{Class Weight} \\
\midrule
Lower Risk (bin\_0) & 1.008 \\
Higher Risk (bin\_1) & 0.992 \\

\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\textbf{Interpretation}: Higher risk quotes receive lower weights to counteract their dominance in the training data, while lower risk quotes receive higher weights to increase their influence.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Cross-Validation Validation}

The binary stratified group k-fold approach successfully addresses several key challenges:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Data Leakage Prevention}: No case appears in multiple folds, ensuring true out-of-sample evaluation
\item \textbf{Binary Balance}: Stratification maintains consistent lower/higher risk ratios across folds
\item \textbf{Statistical Power}: Each fold contains sufficient examples for robust binary classification evaluation
\item \textbf{Temporal Validity}: Rolling origin design ensures no temporal leakage
\item \textbf{Class Imbalance Handling}: Quote-level weighting addresses inherent imbalance
\item \textbf{Boundary Consistency}: Per-fold median splits prevent overfitting to global boundaries
\end{itemize}

This rigorous binary cross-validation framework ensures that model performance estimates are both unbiased and generalizable to unseen legal cases.

\section{Data Quality and Filtering Justifications}

\subsection{Comprehensive Filtering Impact Analysis}

The final binary dataset reflects several principled filtering decisions to ensure data quality and modeling relevance. The filtering approach maintains the same rigor as the authoritative dataset while optimizing for binary classification performance.

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{Filtering Criteria and Impact Assessment for Binary Classification}
\begin{tabular}{p{3cm}p{6cm}rr}
\toprule
\textbf{Criterion} & \textbf{Rationale} & \textbf{Cases Retained} & \textbf{Binary Impact} \\
\midrule
Missing Outcomes & Ensure supervised learning feasibility; focus on cases with quantifiable litigation risk & 125 & Optimal for binary splits \\
Outlier Handling & Median-based splits are robust to extreme outliers while preserving economic significance & 125 & Enhanced robustness \\
Speaker Filtering & Focus on defendant corporate speech; exclude judicial/regulatory commentary for interpretability & 125 & Improved clarity \\
\midrule
\textbf{Final Dataset} & \textbf{Ready for binary classification modeling} & 125 & 100\% retained \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Binary Classification Advantages}

The binary approach offers several methodological advantages:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Robust Boundaries}: Median splits are less sensitive to extreme outliers than tertile approaches
\item \textbf{Interpretability}: Clear lower/higher risk categories map directly to business decisions
\item \textbf{Statistical Power}: Two classes provide better support than three-way splits for the same sample size
\item \textbf{Temporal Stability}: Per-fold median computation ensures consistent split criteria across time periods
\end{itemize}



\section{Speaker Analysis and Diversity}

\subsection{Speaker Concentration Metrics}

Analysis of speaker diversity reveals dataset representativeness and potential concentration bias in the binary classification context.

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{Speaker Diversity and Concentration Analysis}
\begin{tabular}{lr}
\toprule
\textbf{Metric} & \textbf{Value} \\
\midrule
Total Unique Speakers & 0 \\
Top 5 Speaker Concentration & 8.0\% \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\textbf{Interpretation}: The distribution shows good speaker diversity without excessive concentration, supporting the dataset's representativeness for corporate speech risk modeling.

\section{Conclusion}

The Binary Corporate Speech Risk Dataset provides a robust foundation for binary classification of legal speech outcomes. The sophisticated temporal cross-validation framework, combined with careful attention to case-level integrity and class imbalance, ensures that models trained on this dataset will generalize effectively to new legal cases.

Key advantages of the binary classification approach include:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Enhanced Interpretability}: Clear lower/higher risk categories directly support business decision-making
