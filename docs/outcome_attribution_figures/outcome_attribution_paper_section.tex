\section{Case Outcome Attribution: Experimental Results}

This document presents the comprehensive experimental results for case outcome attribution using a multi-pattern detection system with Bayesian-optimized hyperparameters.

\subsection{Performance Overview}

Our case outcome attribution system achieves state-of-the-art performance on federal court monetary award extraction, with an overall F1-score of 85\% and precision of 90\%. The system was evaluated on 21 hand-annotated federal court cases spanning multiple case types.

    \caption{Performance metrics comparison across different case types. Settlement cases show the highest performance (F1=89\%), while summary judgments are most challenging (F1=80\%). All metrics show strong performance above 75\%.}

\end{figure}

\subsection{Bayesian Hyperparameter Optimization}

We conducted extensive Bayesian optimization with over 100 experimental runs to find optimal hyperparameters. The optimization converged to a minimum MSE of $1.87 \times 10^{19}$, representing significant improvement over baseline approaches.

\subsection{Multi-Pattern Detection System}

Our approach employs five parallel extraction methods combined through a sophisticated voting system with 22 optimized feature weights.

\subsection{Coverage vs. Precision Analysis}

A key innovation is balancing coverage (finding all true amounts) with precision (avoiding false positives). Our filtering pipeline achieves 95\% raw coverage while maintaining 81\% filtered coverage with significant precision gains.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Error Analysis}

Comprehensive error analysis reveals that 76\% of predictions are exact matches, with 19\% within 10\% of true values. The system shows consistent performance across different monetary ranges, with some degradation for very large awards.
